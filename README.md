# nextui-native

I'm just trying to replicate the design and some functionality of NextUI for React Native.
Many of the components do not have the full functionality of the original NextUI library.

Here is a list of some of the components that have already been implemented:

- [x] Button
- [x] Checkbox
- [x] Chip
- [x] Input
- [x] Progress
- [x] CircularProgress
- [x] Radio
- [x] Slider
- [x] Spinner
- [x] Switch

## Installation

```sh
npm install @malberee/nextui-native
```

## Usage

```js
import { Button } from '@malberee/nextui-native';

// ...

<Button color="success" variant="flat">
  Button
</Button>
```
